The measurement methodology has been validated considering practical issues like the number of OFDM training symbols used for channel estimation or feedback time. In case of asynchronous users, a time-domain IA decoding filter is also compared to its frequency-domain counterpart. We also evaluated the performance of IA from bit error ratio measurement-based results in comparison to different time-division multiple access transmission schemes. The comparison includes single- and multiple-antenna systems transmitting over the dominant mode of the MIMO channel.

In this paper we characterize the capacity boundary of the
two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel
(BC) when the multiantenna terminals use analog beamforming at
both sides of the link. Basically, the problem reduces to finding
the optimal transmit direction and the optimal power allocation
between users to operate at any point on the boundary. We show
that both optimization problems can be solved in closed form.
First, exploiting the fact that any Pareto optimal pair of rates
must also be Pareto optimal of a convex region defined by the
channel energies, the optimal transmit direction is shown to be
the principal eigenvector of a matrix. Second, the optimal power
allocation is obtained by exploiting again the Pareto optimality of
the sought pair of rates. Although this paper focuses on the BC, the
obtained results also serve to characterize the dual multiple-access
channel (MAC). Moreover, this explicit characterization of the
boundary can be extended to a <em>K</em>-user system for <em>K</em>&gt;2. Numerical

In this letter we study the potential benefits of improper
signaling for a secondary user (SU) in underlay cognitive
radio networks. We consider a basic yet illustrative scenario in
which the primary user (PU) always transmit proper Gaussian
signals and has a minimum rate constraint. After parameterizing
the SU transmit signal in terms of its power and circularity
coefficient (which measures the degree of impropriety), we prove
that the SU improves its rate by transmitting improper signals
only when the ratio of the squared modulus between the SU-PU
interference link and the SU direct link exceeds a given threshold.
As a by-product of this analysis, we obtain the optimal circularity
coefficient that must be used by the SU depending on its power
budget. Some simulation results show that the SU benefits from
the transmission of improper signals especially when the PU is not
highly loaded.

In this paper, we study the multiple-input multiple-output

(AF) strategy, the problem consists of finding the transmit
and receive beamformers of the nodes and relay (as well as the
power allocated to each one) that achieve the boundary of the
optimal rate region. To solve it, we first express the optimal node
beamformers in terms of relay beamformers and then show that
the optimal rate region can efficiently be characterized using
convex optimization techniques. We also extend our study to the
multiple-relay scenario when the source nodes are single antenna
and propose a distributed algorithm to compute the relay beamforming
matrices. The proposed algorithm consists of solving two
different subproblems. First, each individual TWRC is optimized
independently. Next, a distributed beamforming is applied to make
the signals from the relays add up coherently at the source nodes.
Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance

analog beamforming architectures against conventional MIMO
schemes that operate at the baseband.

<blockquote><font size="-1">
In this paper, the impact of improper Gaussian
signaling is studied for an underlay cognitive radio (CR) scenario
comprised of a primary user (PU), which has a rate constraint,
and a secondary user (SU), both single-antenna. We first derive
expressions for the achievable rate of the SU when it transmits
proper and maximally improper Gaussian signals (assuming
that the SU is solely limited by the CR constraint). These
expressions depend on the channel gains to and from the SU
through a single variable. Thereby, we observe that improper
signaling is beneficial whenever the SU rate is below a threshold,
which depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and rate
requirement of the PU. Furthermore, we provide bounds on the
achievable gain that also depend only on the PU parameters.
Then, the achievable rate is studied from a statistical viewpoint
by deriving its cumulative distribution function considering a
constant received SNR at the PU. In addition, we specialize this
expression for the Z interference channel, for which the expected
achievable rate is also derived. Numerical examples illustrate our
claims and show that the SU may significantly benefit from using
improper signaling.

an interference temperature constraint (IT). When the PPL transmits

In this paper we propose a new interference alignment

extensions -either in time or frequency- are employed jointly with
the spatial dimension in the design of the precoders. In this case,
the rank constraint in the direct channels must explicitly be taken
into account into the optimization problem to ensure that there
is no degrees-of-freedom (DoF) loss. To this end, we propose
an algorithm that minimizes the interference leakage while
ensuring that the direct links are full rank and the transmitters
satisfy a power constraint. The algorithm is based upon an
alternating optimization procedure, which solves a generalized
eigenvalue problem at each step. We show through simulations the
advantages of the proposed algorithm in several scenarios that use

multiple-output (MIMO) K-user interference channel (IFC).
In the presence of frequency-selective channels, orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is typically used to deal
with the multipath nature of the channel. While IA techniques
can be applied in a per-subcarrier basis (post-FFT), the existence
of symbol timing offsets (STOs) between the desired and the
interfering OFDM symbols decreases the system performance
dramatically. To solve this problem, we design pre-FFT precoders
and decoders for single-beam MIMO IFCs for OFDM transmissions.
Since the IA decoders operate before the FFT, they
mitigate the interference before synchronization takes place. We
show that our proposed scheme improves the system performance
when STOs occur, in comparison with traditional post-FFT
IA techniques. We provide simulation results to compare post- and
pre-FFT beamforming techniques and to illustrate the
performance of the proposed method.

 A distributed algorithm for two-way multiple-relay networks.

In this paper we propose an efficient transmission
strategy for the two-way relay channel (TWRC) with multiple
relays, when these are multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
transceivers that apply the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol.
Although the optimal beamforming strategy is known, it requires
a central node, with channel state information (CSI) of the entire
network, to compute all the beamforming matrices, which is
impractical. To reduce the overhead, in this paper we present a
distributed algorithm for the computation of the relay beamforming
matrices. The proposed algorithm divides the problem in two
stages. First, each relay computes its own beamforming matrix
in parallel using only local CSI. Next, a distributed beamforming
is applied to make the signals add up coherently at the nodes.
Although the proposed algorithm is suboptimal, we show through
simulations that it performs very close to the optimal achievable
rate region.

An alternating optimization algorithm was recently proposed for the
K-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel.
For flat-fading channels and feasible problems, this algorithm
successfully aligns the interfering signals exploiting the spatial dimensions.
In this paper, we consider the case in which all pairwise
MIMO channels are frequency-selective (convolutive), and the users
transmit broadband signals using a single-carrier scheme. Unlike
the flat-fading case, for frequency-selective channels it is necessary
to add a spectral mask in the frequency response of the precoders and
decoders to avoid trivial solutions. We show in the paper that each
step of the alternating minimization algorithm can be reformulated
as a convex optimization problem in which the autocorrelation function
of the precoders or decoders is obtained. Upon convergence, a
final spectral factorization stage must be applied to obtain the precoders
and decoders from their autocorrelation functions. Simulation
results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed
algorithm.

In this paper we study the multiple-input multiple-output
two-way relay channel (MIMO-TWRC) when the nodes use analog beamforming.
Following the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy, the problem
consists of finding the transmit and receive beamformers of the nodes and
the relay, and the power allocated to each one, that achieve the boundary
of the capacity region. We express the optimal node beamformers in
terms of the relay beamformers, and show that the capacity region can
be efficiently characterized using convex optimization techniques. Numerical
examples are provided to illustrate the results of this paper, and
to compare the capacity region achieved by analog beamforming against
the conventional MIMO schemes that operate at the baseband.
