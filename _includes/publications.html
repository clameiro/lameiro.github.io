	Abstract = {In this paper we characterize the capacity boundary of the
two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel
(BC) when the multiantenna terminals use analog beamforming at
both sides of the link. Basically, the problem reduces to finding
the optimal transmit direction and the optimal power allocation
between users to operate at any point on the boundary. We show
that both optimization problems can be solved in closed form.
First, exploiting the fact that any Pareto optimal pair of rates
must also be Pareto optimal of a convex region defined by the
channel energies, the optimal transmit direction is shown to be
the principal eigenvector of a matrix. Second, the optimal power
allocation is obtained by exploiting again the Pareto optimality of
the sought pair of rates. Although this paper focuses on the BC, the
obtained results also serve to characterize the dual multiple-access
channel (MAC). Moreover, this explicit characterization of the
boundary can be extended to a $K$-user system for $K>2$. Numerical
examples are provided to illustrate the results of the paper, and to
show the enlargement of the capacity region achieved by analog
beamforming in comparison to a single-input single-output (SISO)

which the primary user (PU) always transmit proper Gaussian
signals and has a minimum rate constraint. After parameterizing
the SU transmit signal in terms of its power and circularity
coefficient (which measures the degree of impropriety), we prove
that the SU improves its rate by transmitting improper signals
only when the ratio of the squared modulus between the SU-PU
interference link and the SU direct link exceeds a given threshold.
As a by-product of this analysis, we obtain the optimal circularity

budget. Some simulation results show that the SU benefits from
the transmission of improper signals especially when the PU is not
highly loaded.},

requiring an enormous amount of iterations which substantially
increases with the size of the scenario. To alleviate this drawback,
in this letter we resort to the Gauss-Newton (GN) method, which
is well-known to experience quadratic convergence when the
iterates are sufficiently close to the optimum. We discuss the convergence

several numerical examples showing that it always converges

hence paving a new way for the design of IA algorithms.},

two-way relay channel (MIMO-TWRC) when the nodes
and relay use analog beamforming. Following the amplify-andforward
(AF) strategy, the problem consists of finding the transmit
and receive beamformers of the nodes and relay (as well as the
power allocated to each one) that achieve the boundary of the

beamformers in terms of relay beamformers and then show that
the optimal rate region can efficiently be characterized using
convex optimization techniques. We also extend our study to the
multiple-relay scenario when the source nodes are single antenna
and propose a distributed algorithm to compute the relay beamforming
matrices. The proposed algorithm consists of solving two
different subproblems. First, each individual TWRC is optimized
independently. Next, a distributed beamforming is applied to make
the signals from the relays add up coherently at the source nodes.
Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the performance

signaling is studied for an underlay cognitive radio (CR) scenario

and a secondary user (SU), both single-antenna. We first derive
expressions for the achievable rate of the SU when it transmits
proper and maximally improper Gaussian signals (assuming
that the SU is solely limited by the CR constraint). These
expressions depend on the channel gains to and from the SU
through a single variable. Thereby, we observe that improper
signaling is beneficial whenever the SU rate is below a threshold,
which depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and rate
requirement of the PU. Furthermore, we provide bounds on the
achievable gain that also depend only on the PU parameters.
Then, the achievable rate is studied from a statistical viewpoint
by deriving its cumulative distribution function considering a
constant received SNR at the PU. In addition, we specialize this
expression for the Z interference channel, for which the expected
achievable rate is also derived. Numerical examples illustrate our
claims and show that the SU may significantly benefit from using
improper signaling.},

a given rate requirement at the PPL, typical approaches impose
an interference temperature constraint (IT). When the PPL transmits
multiple streams, however, the spatial structure of the interference

an algorithm that minimizes the interference leakage while

	Abstract = {Interference alignment (IA) has been shown to

In the presence of frequency-selective channels, orthogonal
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is typically used to deal
with the multipath nature of the channel. While IA techniques
can be applied in a per-subcarrier basis (post-FFT), the existence
of symbol timing offsets (STOs) between the desired and the
interfering OFDM symbols decreases the system performance
dramatically. To solve this problem, we design pre-FFT precoders
and decoders for single-beam MIMO IFCs for OFDM transmissions.
Since the IA decoders operate before the FFT, they
mitigate the interference before synchronization takes place. We
show that our proposed scheme improves the system performance
when STOs occur, in comparison with traditional post-FFT
IA techniques. We provide simulation results to compare post- and
pre-FFT beamforming techniques and to illustrate the
performance of the proposed method.},

@inproceedings{LameiroViaSantamaria:2012:A-Distributed-Algorithm-for-Two-Way-Multiple-Relay,
	Abstract = {In this paper we propose an efficient transmission
strategy for the two-way relay channel (TWRC) with multiple
relays, when these are multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
transceivers that apply the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol.
Although the optimal beamforming strategy is known, it requires
a central node, with channel state information (CSI) of the entire
network, to compute all the beamforming matrices, which is
impractical. To reduce the overhead, in this paper we present a
distributed algorithm for the computation of the relay beamforming
matrices. The proposed algorithm divides the problem in two
stages. First, each relay computes its own beamforming matrix
in parallel using only local CSI. Next, a distributed beamforming
is applied to make the signals add up coherently at the nodes.
Although the proposed algorithm is suboptimal, we show through
simulations that it performs very close to the optimal achievable
rate region.},

@inproceedings{GonzalezLameiroVia:2012:Interference-Leakage-Minimization-for-Convolutive,
	Abstract = {An alternating optimization algorithm was recently proposed for the
K-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel.
For flat-fading channels and feasible problems, this algorithm
successfully aligns the interfering signals exploiting the spatial dimensions.
In this paper, we consider the case in which all pairwise
MIMO channels are frequency-selective (convolutive), and the users
transmit broadband signals using a single-carrier scheme. Unlike
the flat-fading case, for frequency-selective channels it is necessary
to add a spectral mask in the frequency response of the precoders and
decoders to avoid trivial solutions. We show in the paper that each
step of the alternating minimization algorithm can be reformulated
as a convex optimization problem in which the autocorrelation function
of the precoders or decoders is obtained. Upon convergence, a
final spectral factorization stage must be applied to obtain the precoders
and decoders from their autocorrelation functions. Simulation
results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed
algorithm.},

Following the amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy, the problem
consists of finding the transmit and receive beamformers of the nodes and

terms of the relay beamformers, and show that the capacity region can
be efficiently characterized using convex optimization techniques. Numerical
